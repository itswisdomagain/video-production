## How Decred Is Unique
### Voice Over Script

Decred is a unique cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin. To see *how* Decred is unique, let's compare the two.

For starters, both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.

Here's where things get interesting.

Bitcoin's block reward is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.

Decred reduces its block reward smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.

New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also receive 100% of the Bitcoin block reward, giving miners all the power.

Decred utilizes a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake protocol where 90% of Decred's block reward is split between proof-of-stake Miners and participating stakeholders called Proof-of-stake Voters. Decred Miners receive 60% of the total block reward for finding blocks while Voters receive 30% for keeping the miners in check.

It works like this:

Every 5 minutes on average, a new Decred block is found by a proof-of-work miner. Contained in each block are 5 votes cast by 5 proof-of-stake voters. These votes, called block votes, are used to decide whether to accept or reject the previous block.

If a majority decides to reject the block, its miner is stripped of their portion of the block reward as punishment for breaking the rules.

By allowing the rejection of blocks, Decred's hybrid protocol provides a mechanism for stakeholders to prevent miner attacks and unwanted hard forks, giving them sovereignty over the Decred chain.

Since Bitcoin employs a pure Proof-of-work protocol, sovereignty over its chain is firmly in the hands of Bitcoin miners, leaving Bitcoin stakeholders powerless.

The differences don't stop there.

The remaining 10% of the Decred block reward is placed in the Decred treasury. The Treasury makes Decred a self-funded open source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO.

How the funds in the Treasury are spent is also determined by participating stakeholders. Through Politeia, the Decred proposal system, anyone can shape the future of Decred by proposing new ideas for stakeholder consideration. All proposals must be approved by stakeholders, giving them sovereignty over Decred's development.

Bitcoin has zero self-funding and is reliant on outside funding and contributions from those willing to work for free.

Decred is a community controlled cryptocurrency with open governance and sustainable funding for development. To become part of the Decred community go to Decred.org/community and join the discussion on one of the many supported social platforms.
