## What Is In This Repo?

#### Pre-Production Materials

All pre-production materials are written in markdown, includes scripts and storyboards.

Creating storyboards in this formant is tedious, but allows for easy viewing directly on GitHub. To help with the creation and editing of storyboards in markdown format, [mdh](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/blob/master/mdh) can be used.

#### mdh (markdown helper)

`mdh` is a command line program designed to allow quick creation and editing of storyboards as markdown files.

With `mdh` you can easily split, add, and remove markdown table rows all without having to manually update the index column or shot-number specific links and filenames.

Learn more about `mdh` [here](https://github.com/raedahgroup/video-production/docs/mdh.md).

#### progress tracking
