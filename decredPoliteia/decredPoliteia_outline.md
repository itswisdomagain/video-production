## Decred: Politeia

#### Outline



**main idea**: Pi is the digital infrastructure built to enable the direct governance of the Decred network by its participants over the internet.



##### Participants

-  users vs stakeholders
  - A user is anyone who stores or exchanges value on the Decred network.
  - A stakeholder is a user who has enough Decred to purchase 1 or more tickets.
- Any user has the right to submit their own projects for self-funding from the Decred block subsidy.
- Stakeholders have the right to cast votes on whether to approve or deny a specific proposal. The more tickets a stakeholder owns, the more votes they are able to cast.



##### What is Pi?

- public chain-anchored and censorship resistant proposals system.

  - Social media application

    - a digital place for users to submit and discuss proposals.
    - chain-anchored
      - data lives off-chain
        - keeps required on-chain storage to a minimum
      - hashes of data episodically stored on chain
        - makes governance data cryptographically verifiable
          - helps resist manipulation of governance by outside or internal forces
    - built to resist common problems with traditional social-media applications.
      - spam/fake accounts
        - annoying and creates data bloat
        - resisted with account creation and posting fees.
        - _where do fees go?_
      - Censorship
        - Human admins necessary to enforce Proposal quality guidelines
          - poor quality posts also contribute to data bloat
          - resisted with censorship tokens
            - gives a user a means of proving their content was censored.

  - Vote counting

    - Stakeholders with live tickets can cast votes to approve or deny proposals.

      - projects that are approved by stakeholders are awarded funding upon project completion.

    - _benefit of off-chain votes?_
