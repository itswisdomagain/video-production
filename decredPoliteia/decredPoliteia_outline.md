## Decred: Politeia

#### Outline



**main idea**: Pi is the _ideal_ infrastructure for the self-governance of a cryptocurrency.

- Why?
  - Solves technical and social challenges associated with self-governance of a cryptocurrency
- what is self-governance? _(or what is needed to be successful?)_
  - governance of the chain, protocol and the spending of the project fund - which is paying the wages of the people who work on the project
- technical challenges and how theyre solved
  - where to store data in a manipulation resistant way?
    - the blockchain, duh... üòé ‚ùå
      - inefficient 
    - off-chain storage anchored to the blockchain üéìüíØ 
      - More efficient than storing on-chain, but allows cryptographic verifiability making it resistant to manipulation
        - data lives off-chain
        - hashes of data episodically stored on chain through dcrTime
        - limits on-chain footprint
  - How to make the platform open, but resistant to data-bloat (i.e. spam posts, fake accounts, low quality posts) ?
    - account creation fees
    - posting fees
      - per proposal
        - where the fees go not yet decided 100% but to the project fund seems most likely
    - quality control
      - proposal guidelines and human review process
        - Introduces mode of censorship ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - How to prevent silent censorship commonly seen in modern social media applications?
    - Censorship tokens
      - creates a transparent censorship process, where censored posters can prove their content was censored.

##### Who can use pi?

-  users and stakeholders
  - A user is anyone who stores or exchanges value on the Decred network.
    - Any user has the right to submit their own projects for self-funding from the Decred block subsidy.
  - A stakeholder is a user who has enough Decred to purchase 1 or more tickets.
    - Stakeholders have the right to cast votes on whether to approve or deny a specific proposal. The more tickets a stakeholder owns, the more votes they are able to cast.
