## Decred in Depth: Politeia
### Voice Over

Named after the Greek term meaning ‘a system of government’--Politeia is the Decred proposal system: a chain-anchored social media application where stakeholders decide which projects recieve funding from the network fund. 

Decred governance data hosted on Politeia is made up of submitted project proposals, comments, and votes. 

This user-sourced data is episodically anchored to the Decred blockchain creating an immutable and cryptographically verifiable public record of Decred self-governance. 

This means the data stored in Politeia can never be altered, deleted, or forged--ensuring that attempts to manipulate Decred's governance are significantly more difficult than if a traditional website or social media application were in use.

To achieve this, Politeia's off-chain storage system makes use of Git (a popular revision control system), and DecredTime (a custom server application for storing timestamps on the Decred blockchain).

Git is utilized to create a historic record of every change to the data stored on Politeia. All revisions recorded by Git are anchored to the Decred blockchain through DecredTime. This "Git plus timestamping" equation results in a time sequence of data revisions that is computationally infeasible to recreate.

On the front end, the Politeia GUI provides an easy to use web-based interface for stakeholders to submit project proposals, comments, and votes.

User registration and Proposal posting fees are implemented to limit fake user accounts and spam posts.

Politeia administrators review all submitted proposals to ensure they conform to basic requirements. This helps to ensure that valuable on-chain storage isn't wasted on low quality posts. 

Unlike conventional social media applications, content on Politeia cannot be silently censored. The owner of any content can use their censorhip token to prove that their content was submitted and whether it was censored.

It works like this: once a user submits a proposal for review, they receive a censorship token. After their proposal has been reviewed and deemed in adherence with guidelines, it becomes available for public consideration.

If a stakeholder's proposal is rejected, their censorship token can be used to prove that their proposal was censored and identify the administrator responsible. 

The use of censorship tokens in this manner allows stakeholders to hold administrators publicly accountable for their actions.

Cryptographically verifiable and censorship resistant, Politeia is the ideal platform for self-governance.
